Soon I will no longer be a dev.

My career has been a little strange, entirely because of timing.

The two year media studies course I took after high school would be unrecognizable to even someone taking the program even five years later. We watched relevant movies on VHS. Editing audio was done by splicing physical reels of tape. I was lucky enough to have a single computer-related class, and that was only basic typing.  

For my work placement I ran lots of errands and making coffee but I quickly became the "tech guy", mostly making the single computer sat in a corner of the office do stuff. No one in the company knew or cared about technology.

For the next five or six years I did jobs that started out as the old school version of the technological jobs that quickly replaced them. The most notable example of this would be my stint as a "Pre-Press Operator". THese days, that job is simply known universally as the "export to PDF" option that exists in almost every digital application.

I had been building websites long before anyone really knew what being a "web developer" was. At the time the only back end language was perl, although PHP was only aroound the corner. However, I was able to build sites that I liked, and eventually that small companies and individuals would pay me to build, so I never considered it vital to learn dynamic languages. That seems like a very strange statement to type in 2022.

As technology progressed at an exponential rate, I learned more and more CSS and even some JavaScript. I was there for DHTML, XHTML and eventually HTML5. I was there for CSS from the days where it was only used to style link states, through to responsive design and eventually SASS. But my earlier decisions haunted me - the furthest I ever got to being an actual developer was copy/pasting parts of WordPress loops.

In 2015 I was granted an amazing opportunity. I joined a fairly large local insurance company with the goal of learning Python and JavaScript, particularly React. I was still useful for my front end experience, but I consider myself extremely fortunate - I was given time, resources and access to some extremely professional and knowledgeable developers.

After seven years I consider myself to be a fairly average developer. I'm certainly not the "live and breathe code" type, and programming doesn't come naturally to me like it appears to for some people. I became quite proficient in React and JavaScript, and I'm "capable" in Python and Django, the Python web framework.

However, my age, bad habits I've accumulated and the direction of technology in general have taken their toll.

Once again, I have been given an amazing opportunity. After talking with my manager over a period of perhaps six months, an opportunity has arisen for me to move sideways to automated QA, and soon I will make the move. This new position seems almost tailor-made for where I have ended up. Active development is extremely muti-faceted, to the point where I find it overwhelming. Automated QA is a position where I can leverage my Python and front end knowledge without having to deal with every aspect of full stack app development.

I still love the web, and I'll be sad to no longer be directly building for it. But I'm optimistic that I can still be productive and still make a difference for my company.
