<p class="lead">A list of random facts and tidbits about me, in no particular order.</p>

<ul id="ama">
  <li>I once jumped out of a plane. (more accurately, a guy jumped out of a plane with me strapped to him)</li>
  <li>I started learning how to make bread before Covid19 made it cool.</li>
  <li>I learned how to make my own bacon and cured meats, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves bacon. It's not that hard!</li>
  <li>I spent the first <span id="years"></span> years of my life in London, England.</li>
  <li>I've spent the last 20 years of my life in Windsor, Ontario in Canada.</li>
  <li>I enjoy woodworking, I suspect mostly because after spending 20 years in digital careers it's so refreshing and enriching to build things in the real world.</li>
  <li>I'm not much of a traveller, but I <strong>love</strong> maps, and pretty much any visual representation of geography.</li>
  <li>Favourite food: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_pudding" target="_blank">Yorkshire Pudding</a>.</li>
  <li>I lived for 25 years in one of the diggest cities in the world (population ~11m). I spent the following 15 years in a much smaller city (population ~250k). Since then I've lived just outside a tiny town (population ~300).</li>
  <li>I've always been a huge movie and TV fan, starting with 2 years of post-secondary media studies.</li>
  <li>Throughout most of life, teaching has been a big part of my career and life in general. Currently I teach 4 hours per week at a local college.</li>
  <li>I still have my wisdom teeth.</li>
  <li>I no longer have my appendix.</li>
  <li>Spaces, not tabs (if you know, you know).</li>
  <li>I visited Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus and the Netherlands while I lived in Europe, and now I regret not travelling more while I was there. Since moving to Canada I have travelled a lot around the US and vacationed in the Dominican Republic.</li>
  <li>I love music of almost every genre, but alternative rock and grunge will always have a place in my heart.</li>
  <li>I've seen many bands in concert, including The White Stripes, Guns n' Roses, Metallica, Pearl Jam, Paul Simon, The Goo Goo Dolls, The Psychedelic Furs and Counting Crows.</li>
  <li>I've been building websites since the inception of the internet.</li>
  <li>Breakfast is the best meal of any day.</li>
  <li>Currently Android, contemplating a switch.</li>
  <li>I'm pretty comfortable with Mac, Windows and most Linux variants. Given the choice though, I'm almost always Mac.</li>
