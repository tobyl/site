<p class="lead">A list of random facts and tidbits about me, in no particular order.</p>

<ul id="ama">
  <li>I once jumped out of a plane (more accurately, a guy jumped out of a plane with me strapped to him).</li>
  <li>I started learning how to make bread before COVID-19 made it cool.</li>
  <li>I learned how to make my own bacon and cured meats, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves bacon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQUUb8kMfQA">It's not that hard</a>!</li>
  <li>I spent the first <span id="years"></span> years of my life in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/London,+UK/@51.528308,-0.3817809,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47d8a00baf21de75:0x52963a5addd52a99!8m2!3d51.5087425!4d-0.1263428">London, England</a>.</li>
  <li>I've spent the last 20 years of my life in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Windsor,+ON/@42.2949797,-83.0729222,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x883b2ac1b54f886b:0xb66cd49527fcdc51!8m2!3d42.3149367!4d-83.0363633">Windsor, Ontario</a> in Canada.</li>
  <li>I enjoy woodworking, I suspect because after 20 years working in the digital realm it's incredibly refreshing and enriching to build things in the real world.</li>
  <li>I'm not much of a traveller, but I <strong>love</strong> maps, and pretty much any visual representation of geography.</li>
  <li>Favourite food: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_pudding">Yorkshire Pudding</a>.</li>
  <li>I lived for 25 years in one of the biggest cities in the world (population ~11m). I spent the following 15 years in a much smaller city (population ~250k). Since then I've lived just outside a tiny town (population ~300).</li>
  <li>I've always been a huge movie and TV buff, starting with 2 years of post-secondary media studies.</li>
  <li>Teaching has been a big part of my career and my life in general. Currently I teach four hours per week at a local college.</li>
  <li>I still have my wisdom teeth.</li>
  <li>I no longer have my appendix.</li>
  <li>Spaces, not tabs (if you know, you know).</li>
  <li>I visited Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus and the Netherlands while I lived in Europe, and now I regret not travelling more while I was there. Since moving to Canada I have travelled around the US and vacationed in the Dominican Republic.</li>
  <li>I love music of almost every genre, but alternative rock and grunge will always have a place in my heart.</li>
  <li>I've seen many bands in concert, including The White Stripes, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Pearl Jam, Paul Simon, The Goo Goo Dolls, The Psychedelic Furs and Counting Crows.</li>
  <li>I've been building websites since the inception of the internet.</li>
  <li>Breakfast is the best meal of any day.</li>
  <li>Currently Android, contemplating a switch.</li>
  <li>I'm pretty comfortable with Mac, Windows and most Linux variants. Given the choice though, I'm almost always Mac.</li>
